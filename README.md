# Object Detection with YOLOv8 - IIIT Hyderabad Internship 2025

Welcome to the repository for my internship project at IIIT Hyderabad, focused on real-time object detection using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) by Ultralytics.

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of pretrained YOLOv8 models for detecting objects in images. It is part of the Internship Program 2025 designed to foster rapid skill acquisition and hands-on experience with real-world AI/ML applications.

## Objectives

- Understand and implement object detection using YOLOv8.
- Explore the process of loading pretrained models and running inference on custom images.
- Analyze the results and visualize detected objects.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: Ultralytics YOLOv8
- **Libraries**: `ultralytics`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
