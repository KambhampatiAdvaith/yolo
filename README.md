# YOLOv8 Object Detection ‚Äì Short Term IIITH Internship 2025

This repository contains my work as part of the **Short Term iHub Internship 2025**, where I'm learning to implement object detection using **YOLOv8** developed by **Ultralytics**. The main goal is to get comfortable with new tools quickly, apply them to real-world tasks, and grow through hands-on practice.

## üîç What This Project Is About

The focus is on:
- Using **pretrained YOLOv8 models** to detect objects in images.
- Understanding how object detection works in real-time applications.
- Gaining practical experience working with one of the most popular deep learning models in computer vision.

This is my starting point for exploring the world of object detection.
